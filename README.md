## abstract

The Conference Room Booking Management System is a simple program that helps users book, view, and cancel conference room reservations. It checks whether a room is available before booking, which prevents double-booking and scheduling conflicts. The project uses basic programming concepts like menu-driven options, validation, and data storage (optional). It is designed to make room scheduling easy and well-organized inside an office or institution.

## Summary

This project allows users to manage conference room bookings in a simple way. Users can see available rooms, book a room for a specific date and time, cancel bookings, and view all reservations. The system ensures that no two people book the same room at the same time. Overall, it provides an easy and effective solution for handling meeting room schedules.
